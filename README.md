Remember to put the square in the triangle.

Extract the puzzlebox using unzip once receiving the file

Sort the blocks into the correct holes! If you find any garbage, remove it with "rm".
If a block doesn't have a hole, create it with "mkdir".
Use "cd" to navigate through the folders and "mv" to move blocks between folders.
When everything is sorted, go to the "whenEverythingIsSorted" folder.

Good luck! :D



navigating:
wget [link]
cat [textFile]
unzip [zippedPuzzlebox]
ls
cd ..
cd [folder]

sorting blocks:
mv [block/source] [hole/destination]
rm [garbage]
mkdir [newFolder]

final steps:
touch [newTxtFile]
pwd
